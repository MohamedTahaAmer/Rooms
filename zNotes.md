# Notes
```js
// 1- css height:fit-content and height:auto
  // - the fit content will make the hieght follow the content with no respect to the paretns height, so the child might exeed the parens height
  // - in auto, lets the browser determins the height, which is to fit-contnet with max-height of parents hieght, so it won't exeed it's parents
  // h-100% means take the same height as the parent
